# landing-page

This project is practice creating an entire web page based on the Odin project specification. While taking some liberty myself to customnize it to how I see fit.
The goal of this project is not to be pixel-perfect to the examples the Odin project provides, but to practice the concepts I've learend as relating to flexbox, 
CSS and HTML.
